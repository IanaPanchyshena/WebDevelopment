			<strong><dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt></strong>
			<dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
				The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and
				cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
			<strong><dt>What should I bring?</dt></strong>
